# React, Next.js and Tailwind Template Project

## What's all this then?

This is a basic template project for React, Next.js and Tailwind designed to help speed up the process of creating a frontend application.

There are some (very) basic examples within the application itself to get started with, but the main aim is to provide and initial setup. This template is extended from a general project template that can be found [here](https://github.com/Sezguin/template-repository).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open ```http://localhost:3000``` with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
